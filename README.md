I found few hexagon CSS generators online, but I needed one with clear and smooth borders to my next project. So I made one based on polygon clip-path.

CSS Hexagon generator: 
Fill data to find out if this hexagon is going to fit into your page, and generate HTML and CSS code to copy it for your use.
I used specific range and steps on range inputs, but if you need you can override it by typing your data to number inputs (for e.g. if u need decimals in hexagon width or your shadow should be further than 100px).
